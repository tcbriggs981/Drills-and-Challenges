-- QUESTION 1

SELECT * FROM listings
ORDER BY price DESC
LIMIT 20;

-- The most expensive listing costs 9,999 it's ID is 27418553. It has 0 reviews and is available 359 days a year.
-- To find a listing that actually gets rented, the next mos expensive is ID: 27503535. It costs $8652 and is available
-- 179 days a year.


-- QUESTION 2

SELECT neighbourhood, COUNT(*) as total_listings , AVG(price) as average_price
FROM listings
GROUP BY neighbourhood
ORDER BY 2 DESC;

-- Embajadores, Universidad, Palacio, & Sol are by far the neighbourhoods with the most listings. I pulled in 
-- average price as well to see if there was a correlation to amount of listings and the price but while none
-- of them are cheap by any means, they are not quite the most expensive. Embajadores is the most listed neighbourhood
-- and with an average price of $117, it might not be the smartest choice.


-- QUESTION 3
-- Most Expensive:

SELECT 
	EXTRACT(MONTH FROM ca.calender_date),
	AVG(l.price)
FROM
	calender ca
JOIN
	listings l
ON
	ca.listing_id = l.id
WHERE ca.available = 't'
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 2 DESC;

-- October is the most expensive time of the year, followed by November and December
-- June is the cheapest but the difference between January through September is marginal and the average price jumps
-- up by $10 when you enter December.


-- Busiest:

SELECT 
	EXTRACT(MONTH FROM calender_date),
	COUNT(EXTRACT(MONTH FROM calender_date))
FROM
	calender
WHERE available = 't'
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 2;

-- October is by far the busiest month of the year, with only 145803 available listings, followed by June & September.
-- The least busy month is March, with 282008 available listings.
