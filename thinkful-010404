The Sith Lords are concerned that their recruiting slogan, "Give In to Your Anger," isn't very effective. Darth Vader develops an alternative slogan, "Together We Can Rule the Galaxy." They compare the slogans on two groups of 50 captured droids each. In one group, Emperor Palpatine delivers the "Anger" slogan. In the other, Darth Vader presents the "Together" slogan. 20 droids convert to the Dark Side after hearing Palpatine's slogan, while only 5 droids convert after hearing Vader's. The Sith's data scientist concludes that "Anger" is a more effective slogan and should continue to be used.

A: By giving each slogan back to back to the same group, you immediately lower the effectiveness of the second slogan. They should have gotten 2 equally sized, & equally diverse samples then presented each one of the slogans.

In the past, the Jedi have had difficulty with public relations. They send two envoys, Jar Jar Binks and Mace Windu, to four friendly and four unfriendly planets respectively, with the goal of promoting favorable feelings toward the Jedi. Upon their return, the envoys learn that Jar Jar was much more effective than Windu: Over 75% of the people surveyed said their attitudes had become more favorable after speaking with Jar Jar, while only 65% said their attitudes had become more favorable after speaking with Windu. This makes Windu angry, because he is sure that he had a better success rate than Jar Jar on every planet. The Jedi choose Jar Jar to be their representative in the future.

A: This depends on the demographics of each planet. A larger sample size might help but also with 65% & 75% being decently close, it would be worth checking into the demographic breakdown of each planet so as to see how each performed.

A company with work sites in five different countries has sent you data on employee satisfaction rates for workers in Human Resources and workers in Information Technology. Most HR workers are concentrated in three of the countries, while IT workers are equally distributed across worksites. The company requests a report on satisfaction for each job type. You calculate average job satisfaction for HR and for IT and present the report.

A: When presenting the data, you should break it down by location as well. Which of the three countries has the highest happiness for HR workers? Which of the five has the happiest IT workers? Is there a correlation? Does not having HR at an office effect overall happiness?

When people install the Happy Days Fitness Tracker app, they are asked to "opt in" to a data collection scheme where their level of physical activity data is automatically sent to the company for product research purposes. During your interview with the company, they tell you that the app is very effective because after installing the app, the data show that people's activity levels rise steadily.

A: This is problematic because it needs to track a longer time than just after installing the app. A user may only use the app for a while and then begin to drop off, so basing effectiveness only on the early stages doesn't factor in the long-term (or even medium-term) effectiveness of the app.

To prevent cheating, a teacher writes three versions of a test. She stacks the three versions together, first all copies of Version A, then all copies of Version B, then all copies of Version C. As students arrive for the exam, each student takes a test. When grading the test, the teacher finds that students who took Version B scored higher than students who took either Version A or Version C. She concludes from this that Version B is easier, and discards it.

A: The sample of who was given Version C might be different than Version B. I would check to see if there were any outliers, like a perfect score on Version B or an especially bad score on Version C that is weighing their averages.
